Today, we'll launch a Continuous Deployment pipeline in the AWS Cloud.

## An Introductory Workshop on CI/CD Practices

In few hours, quickly learn how to effectively leverage various AWS services to improve developer productivity and reduce the overall time to market for new product capabilities. In this session, we will demonstrate a prescriptive approach to incrementally adopt and embrace some of the best practices around continuous integration & delivery using AWS Developer Tools and 3rd party solutions including, AWS CodeCommit (a managed source control service), AWS CodeBuild (a fully managed build service), Jenkins (an open source automated build server), CodePipeline (a fully managed continuous delivery service), and CodeDeploy (an automated application deployment service). We will also highlight some best practices and productivity tips that can help make your software release process fast, automated, and reliable.

See the diagram below for a depiction of the complete architecture.
